# Types

This types only used to help us to distinguish a wide variety of numbers and strings. If you are this industry maybe you met some of these issues:

```typescript
phoneNumber: string;
bankAccountNumber: string;
healthFundNumber: string;
```
... and many of theses. This "numbers" are strings in real.

And there are real numbers, but of course you should be avoid mixing them. You can't multiply an "amount of credits" with "amount of money" even if both are numbers and technically it's possible.

So this custom types help you avoid mistakes in your codes. Fist place with avoiding mixing types.
